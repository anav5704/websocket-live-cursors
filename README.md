# Live Cursors App
This is a realtime app which shares the curors of all currently connected users using web sockets. I was unable tp deploy the web socket server so if you want to check out how this looks, feel free to follow the initialisation.

# Technologies Used
- React JS
- Web Sockets
- Node JS

#  Initialisation
First go on and fork and clone this repo. Then, go into both the folders and run ```npm intsall``` in them separately. Now cd into the server folder and run ```node index.js``` and run ```npm run dev```  in the client folder.
