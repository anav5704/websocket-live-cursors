# Live Cursors App
This is a real-time app that shares the cursors of all currently connected users using web sockets. I was unable to deploy the web socket server so if you want to check out how this looks, feel free to follow the initialisation.

# Technologies Used
- React JS
- Web Sockets
- Node JS

#  Initialisation
First, go on and fork and clone this repo. Then, go into both the folders and run ```npm install `` in them separately. After the dependencies are done installing, cd into the server folder and run ```node index.js``` and run ```npm run dev```  in the client folder.
