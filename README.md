# Live Cursors App ☝️

This is a real-time app that shares the cursors of all currently connected users using web sockets. I was unable to deploy the web socket server so if you want to check out how this looks, feel free to follow the getting started guide.

## Technologies Used
- React JS
- Node JS
- Web Sockets

##  Getting Started

First, go on and fork and clone this repo. Then, go into both the folders and run ```npm install ``` in them separately. After the dependencies are done installing, cd into the server folder and run ```node index.js``` and run ```npm run dev```  in the client folder. Now you can go to localhost on your browser and use the app. Just enter a username into the form and you're all done.
